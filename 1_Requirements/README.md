# Introduction

Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included three additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas .However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2 "(i.e 2+4).

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder operator %% is used in the first printf() function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen.

## Why:
To reduce the complexity  calculations.
I’m making this to do all type of calculations in one place.
It can be used by anyone at any place.
## Where:
This can be used in our daily live.
We can use it for any type of  calculation.
## Who:
It can be used by anyone .
Can be used as a reference for  calculations.
## When:
One can calculate  anywhere.
The project can be used when the financial calculations are required and the result will be obtained fastly.
# How:
By giving different amounts one can find their desired output.
It will be helpful in performing various calculations.

# Swot Analysis
## STRENGTHS

The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

## WEAKNESSES

do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

## OPPORTUNITIES

The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

## THREATS

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
